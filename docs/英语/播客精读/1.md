That was the main thing, wanting to expand my game. | 这是主要原因，我想扩展我的比赛技能。

我想起我们之前的一次谈话，关于走到边线时，教练害怕改变战术，因为他知道某些球员
can't run it on the opposite side.
不能在另一边执行。
Right.
对的。
Right.
对的。
Right.
对的。
And and I I I attest to that like that's and you can get in practice too like we can have we can run the same play over and over and over and if the coach say okay let's run it from
我完全同意这一点，在训练中也会遇到这种情况，我们可以一遍又一遍地练同样的战术，如果教练说好的，让我们从
the the left side we've been running from the right side guys like three dudes are lost three guys like where what are we doing you know then the main guy then the main cheers cheers
左边开始执行，我们一直从右边开始，就像三个家伙迷路了，三个家伙不知道我们在做什么，然后主要球员，然后主要的欢呼声
absolutely appreciate you and then it's like as the best player or the most efficient scorer or the you who got the best matchup,
绝对感谢你，然后作为最好的球员或最高效的得分手，或者是有最好对位的你，
whoever you call him to play for.
无论你叫他为谁效力。
It's just like when coach says,
就像教练说的，
"Oh, he can't we can't do this because he not strong going left or he can't go right."
"哦，我们不能这样做，因为他向左不够强，或者他不能向右。"
That just always did something to me.
这总是触动我。
And it was tough for me to go left sometimes and pull up for the jump shot,
有时候我很难往左走然后急停跳投，
especially early on my first few years.
特别是在我刚开始的几年里。
And I think I started to understand the footwork,
我觉得我开始理解脚步技术，
the balance, of what it takes to shoot going right from inside the paint,
平衡感，以及从禁区内向右投篮需要什么，
free throw line extended, college three,
罚球线延长线，大学三分线，
NBA three, you know.
NBA三分线，你知道的。
So, and and that's why in that small detail is the reason I think my game is,
所以，这些小细节就是我认为我的比赛风格
you know, rounded.
你知道，全面的原因。
You prefer going left.
你更喜欢向左。
I actually now I do.
实际上现在我确实喜欢。
But you started going right.
但你开始是向右的。
是的。
But this is this is actually that's interesting to me,
但这对我来说确实很有趣，
right?
对吧？
Because you you it bothered you that you had one side that was weaker than the other.
因为你不喜欢一边比另一边弱。
But statistically he prefer and prolific going left.
但从统计上看，他更喜欢也更擅长向左。
But actually statistically as good or better going right.
但实际上从统计数据看，向右也同样好或更好。
Yeah.
是的。
Now sometimes that's because people know you want to go left.
现在有时候那是因为人们知道你想往左走。
Yeah.
是的。
Exactly.
正是如此。
But it also proves like it's just a habit to go left.
但这也证明了往左只是一个习惯。
You just prefer I used to play that way too.
你只是更喜欢，我以前也是这样打的。
I play out of a hesy to the left.
我从左边的犹豫步开始。
I could still do it to the right,
我仍然可以向右做，
but I was just comfortable.
但我就是更舒服。
Do you feel like you got more leverage in your body going left for some reason?
你觉得向左时身体的杠杆作用更大吗？
Like, you know, this is a weird one to say,
你知道，这说起来有点奇怪，
but like when I was in the 10th grade,
但当我在10年级的时候，
I sprain my left ankle as a right-handed player,
作为右手球员，我扭伤了左脚踝，
left-handed jumper.
左手投篮。
I never I didn't want to stop playing.
我从来不想停止打球。
So, I played limping around for six months.
所以，我瘸着腿打了六个月的球。
That ankle's never quite been the same.
那个脚踝从来没有完全恢复。
So, I think like pushing off my right became my facto.
所以，我觉得用右脚发力成了我的习惯。
That makes sense.
这说得通。
And so I could do the rhythm going to the right.
所以我可以向右保持节奏。
But you know, to take it one step further about me,
但你知道，关于我再进一步说，
but when I went to Phoenix in 2004,
但当我2004年去凤凰城时，
that summer I was like, I can't play this way anymore where I just go all the way left and pull up right.
那个夏天我想，我不能再这样打球了，只会一路向左然后右侧急停。
And it bothered me.
这困扰着我。
So I spent that summer saying like,
所以我花了那个夏天在想，
I have to figure this movement pattern out,
我必须找出这个动作模式，
like left, hard, pull up.
比如向左，急停，跳投。
And I took it took a summer of like every day trying to get the footwork,
我花了一个夏天，每天都在练习脚步动作，
the balance, the the stability.
平衡感，还有稳定性。
That sounds like you kind of did that early in your career.
听起来你在职业生涯早期就这样做了。
Yeah.
是的。
I mean, it's crazy you said that cuz when I got to Golden State and we started working out more,
我是说，你这么说很疯狂，因为当我到达金州勇士队，我们开始更多训练时，
you told me that and it's always stuck,
你告诉过我这点，这一直印在我心里，
you know, stuck in my mind that like,
你知道，一直在我脑海中，就像，
yeah, the defense know if you going left,
是的，防守知道如果你往左走，
most of the time you going all the way to the cup.
大部分时间你会一路杀到篮筐。
So, that one two dribble pull up going left has been u a staple for me,
所以，向左的一到两次运球急停跳投已经成为我的招牌动作，
but it's more so about the the pickup of the ball.
但更重要的是拿球的时机。
You know what I'm saying?
你知道我在说什么吗？
Going left.
向左时。
Like sometimes I try to pick the ball up right here like my normal shot.
有时候我试图在这里拿球，就像我正常的投篮一样。
they swiping that down instead of we do we did this a lot too.
他们会把球拍掉，而不是我们，我们也经常这样做。
I start, you know, changing my pickups and I'm shooting the ball this way now.
我开始，你知道，改变我的拿球方式，现在我这样投篮。
So, a lot of that stuff is just adjustments to how the def how physical the defense was and and you know me just wanting to get shots off.
所以，很多这些东西只是对防守有多激烈的调整，你知道我只是想要出手投篮。
But this this you make it sound simple.
但你说得好像很简单。
The reason he's able to do that like take the ball up in different areas is because especially at your size,
他能够在不同区域拿球的原因是，特别是在你这个身高，
your balance is so good.
你的平衡感非常好。
Your feet are so good.
你的脚步非常好。
That's where it all starts with.
这就是一切的开始。
He gets on balance.
他保持平衡。
So like it he still has legs under him.
所以他仍然有支撑的腿部力量。
So it doesn't matter if he brings it up normal.
所以无论他正常举球还是
He brings it up here.
在这里举球。
He brings it up there.
在那里举球。
He's always still got legs to get under his shot and get that thing up in the air.
他总是有腿部力量来支撑投篮，让球飞向空中。
That's like those are the little bits that people don't understand that you have to work every day getting down,
这就像那些人们不理解的小细节，你必须每天练习蹲得更低，
getting deeper, getting in a position to have your legs under you.
蹲得更深，让你的腿部有支撑力量。
Yeah.
是的。
I mean, just being able to understand the power that you have under you and your legs and and and letting that flow through your whole body to get to your jump shot.
我是说，能够理解你腿部的力量，让这股力量流过你的整个身体来完成跳投。
It take a while for you to understand how much power you really have,
你需要一段时间才能理解你真正拥有多少力量，
but the lower you play, the harder you dribble the ball back up into your pocket.
但你打得越低，你运球回到口袋位置就越用力。
All that small stuff matters if you want to be a good shooter,
如果你想成为一个好射手，所有这些小细节都很重要，
right?
对吧？
And it makes sense.
这很有道理。
I mean, all the detail that you're talking about is,
我是说，你谈论的所有细节是，
you know, when we talk about efficiency,
你知道，当我们谈论效率时，
you know, and there's only been a small select few guys to do this NBA history,
你知道，在NBA历史上只有少数几个精英球员能做到，
the the 9050 40 club or 50 40 90,
90-50-40俱乐部或50-40-90俱乐部，
however you want to break it down.
无论你怎么划分。
You've done it twice.
你做到过两次。
You've done it twice and it was actually 10 years apart from when you did it.
你做到过两次，实际上两次相隔了10年。
I think the first time you did it was in 13 and I believe the last time was 23.
我记得你第一次是在2013年，我相信最后一次是2023年。
Yep.
是的。
Um, but you want to know who's actually the leader in the 50 40 90 club?
